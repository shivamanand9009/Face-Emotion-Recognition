# Facial Emotion Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a facial emotion recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system analyzes facial expressions in images and predicts the predominant emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

## Features
- Utilizes TensorFlow and OpenCV for facial detection and emotion classification.
- Supports real-time processing of facial images from webcams or batch processing of image datasets.
- Trained model capable of recognizing emotions with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
